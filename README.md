## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

1. Connect the USB-C port on the board to a USB Type-C or USBPD-enabled power adapter for operation.

2. EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU is connected to the KitProg3 via the 10-pin header which includes the I2C connections, SCL, and SDA. Table 1 lists the kits and connections with their corresponding port number.
These pins are configurable in the Device Configurator.

**Table 1. KitProg3 I2C SCL and SDA connections**

| KitProg3 pin connection  | I2C_SCL(J3.4) | I2C_SDA(J3.6) | SWDIO(J3.9) | SWDCLK(J3.7) |
| :-------  | :-------  | :-------  | :-------  | :--------  |
| PMG1-CY7110    | P2.3(J7.6) | P2.2(J7.7) | P0.0(J7.10) | P0.1(J7.9)    |
| PMG1-CY7111    | P5.1(J7.6) | P5.0(J7.7) | P1.4(J7.10) | P1.0(J7.9)    |
| PMG1-CY7112    | P0.1(J7.6) | P0.0(J7.7) | P2.0(J7.10) | P2.1(J7.9)    |
| PMG1-CY7113    | P4.0(J7.7) | P4.1(J7.6) | P1.2(J7.16) | P1.1(J7.17)   |

3. If UART DEBUG PRINT messages are enabled, UART connections are needed. Pin connections for UART is as shown in the following table. For the following revisions of the PMG1 prototyping kits, connect the UART Tx and UART Rx lines from the PMG1 kit to J3.8 and J3.10 on KitProg3 respectively to establish a UART connection between KitProg3 and the PMG1 device.

**Table 2. Pin connections for UART**

|PMG1 kit              | UART Tx       | UART Rx       |
| :------------------------------  | :-------------| :-------------|
|PMG1-CY7110 | --- | --- |
|PMG1-CY7111 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |
|PMG1-CY7112 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |
|PMG1-CY7113 (revision 3 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10 |

**Note:** All PMG1 prototyping kits with a higher revision have UART pins internally connected. Therefore, external wiring is not required.


## Software setup

This example uses [Bridge Control Panel](https://www.infineon.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) to send commands to KitProg3 on the kit. Bridge Control Panel is a tool included in the installation of PSoC&trade; Programmer, and available in the installation directory (such as *C:\Program Files (x86)\Cypress\Programmer\Bridge Control Panel\1.22.0\USBtoI2C.exe*).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[I2c Slave Led](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-slave-led)" application with the desired name "MyI2cSlaveLed" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-slave-led --user-app-name MyI2cSlaveLed --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the PMG1-CY7110 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyI2cSlaveLed" --add-bsp-name PMG1-CY7110 --add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_3.0/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyI2cSlaveLed" --set-active-bsp APP_PMG1-CY7110
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Verify the power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


4. After programming, place the power selection jumper (J5) at position 1-2 and connect the USB Type-C connector (J10) on the kit to a USB PD source device via the USB Type-C to Type-C cable.
As soon as the kit is programmed and the USB PD port (J10) is connected, LED3 will be in the OFF state at the start.

5. Open Bridge Control Panel and connect to KitProg3 under the listed ports.

6. I2C pins from KitProg3 are already connected to the assigned pins on each EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU prototyping kit. See the kit user guide for details.

7. Send the I2C commands on the Bridge Control Panel in the following format to turn ON the user LED:

   `w 08 00 01 00 17 p`

   Similarly, to turn OFF the user LED, send the following command:

   `w 08 00 01 01 17 p`

   If the command is 0, the user LED will turn ON. If the command is 1, the user LED will turn OFF.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on the CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

**Figure 2. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/flowchart.png" width = "200"/>
<br>

An SCB block configured as an EZI2C slave peripheral is used here. To implement the EZI2C slave peripheral based on the SCB hardware block, EZI2C slave peripheral driver library APIs are used.

The EZI2C slave peripheral is initialized with the following settings:
   - Data rate: 100 kbps
   - Slave address: 0x08
   - Clock input of the block: Connected to a 12-MHz PERI-derived clock
   - Wake from Deep Sleep on address match: Disabled
   - Number of addresses: 1

The EZI2C slave peripheral requires the I2C master to start the operation with sending a base address that is one or two bytes before sending the data. Following the base address, there is a sequence of bytes written into the buffer starting from the base address location. In this code example, the base address is set to '0'.

**Figure 3. EZI2C slave configuration for EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S0 MCU**

<br>

**Note:** For EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S0 MCU, SCB1 is used for EZI2C slave.

<img src = "images/i2c_slave_pins.png" width = "800"/>
<br>

### Packet format sent by the master to the slave

The master sends a command packet to the slave via I2C to control the status of the LED. The packet must follow the format as specified: a `Start of Packet (SoP)` followed by the command, and then the `End of Packet (EoP)`. The command is executed only if the SoP and EoP are correctly received.

| SoP  | LED status | EoP  |
|------|------------|------|
| 0x01 | 0x00 or 0x01 | 0x17 |

### Compile-time configurations

The EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU I2C slave LED application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameter that can be turned ON/OFF through the *main.c* file.
 Macro name          | Description                           | Allowed values
 :------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :-------------
 `DEBUG_PRINT`     | Debug print macro to enable UART print <br> For S0 - Debug print will be always zero because SCB UART is not available. | 1u to enable <br> 0u to disable |
