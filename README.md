## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

The USB-C port on the board should be connected to a USB Type-C or USBPD-enabled power adapter for operation.

EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU is connected to the KitProg3 via the 10-pin header which includes the I2C connections, SCL, and SDA. [Table 1](#table-1-KitProg3-I2C-SCL-and-SDA-connections) list the kits and connections with their corresponding port number.
These pins are configurable in the Device Configurator.

**Table 1. KitProg3 I2C SCL and SDA connections**

| KitProg3 pin connection  | I2C_SCL(J3.4) | I2C_SDA(J3.6) | SWDIO(J3.9) | SWDCLK(J3.7) |
| :-------  | :-------  | :-------  | :-------  | :--------  |
| PMG1-CY7110    | (J7.6)/(P2.3) | (J7.7)/(P2.2) | (J7.10)/(P0.0) | (J7.9)/(P0.1)    |
| PMG1-CY7111    | (J7.6)/(P5.1) | (J7.7)/(P5.0) | (J7.10)/(P1.4) | (J7.9)/(P1.0)    |
| PMG1-CY7112    | (J7.6)/(P0.1) | (J7.7)/(P0.0) | (J7.10)/(P2.0) | (J7.9)/(P2.1)    |
| PMG1-CY7113    | (J7.7)/(P4.0) | (J7.6)/(P4.1) | (J7.16)/(P1.2) | (J7.17)/(P1.1)    |


## Software setup

This example uses [Bridge Control Panel](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) to send commands to KitProg3 on the kit. Bridge Control Panel is a tool included in the installation of PSOC&trade; Programmer. Once PSOC&trade; Programmer is installed, Bridge Control Panel can be accessed in the installation directory ( Example of an installation directory: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Cypress\Programmer\Bridge Control Panel\1.22.0\USBtoI2C.exe*). 

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[I2c slave LED](https://github.com/infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-slave-led)" application with the desired name "I2cSlaveLed" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-slave-led --user-app-name I2cSlaveLed --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Verify the power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=PMG1-CY7110 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


4. After programming, place the power selection jumper (J5) at position 1-2 and connect the USB Type-C connector (J10) on the kit to a USBPD source device via the USB Type-C to Type-C cable.
As soon as the kit is programmed and USBPD(J10) port is connected, LED3 will be in the OFF state at the start.

5. Open Bridge Control Panel and connect to KitProg3 under the listed ports. 

6. I2C pins from KitProg3 are already connected to the assigned pins on each EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU prototyping kit. See the kit user guide for details.
 
7. Send the I2C commands on the Bridge Control Panel in the following format to turn ON the user LED: `w 08 00 01 00 17 p`. Similarly to turn OFF the user LED, send the following command from Bridge control Panel:  `w 08 00 01 01 17 p`

If the command is 0, the user LED will turn ON. If the command is 1, the user LED will turn OFF.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/flowchart.png" width = "300"/>
<br>

An SCB block configured as an EZI2C slave peripheral is used here. To implement the EZI2C slave peripheral based on the SCB hardware block, EZI2C slave peripheral driver library APIs are used. 

The EZI2C slave peripheral is initialized with the following settings:
   - The data rate is set to 100kbps.
   - The slave address is set to 0x08.
   - The clock input of the block is connected to a 12-MHz PERI-derived clock.
   - The Wake from Deep Sleep on address match is disabled
   - The number of addresses is set to 1.
   
The EZI2C requires the I2C master to start the operation with sending a base address that is one or two bytes before sending the data. Following the base address, there is a sequence of bytes wrriten into the buffer starting from the base address location. In this code example, base address is set to 0.

<br>

**Note:** For EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S0 MCU, SCB1 is used for EZI2C slave.

<br>

### Packet format sent by the master to the slave

The master sends a command packet to the slave via I2C to control the status of the LED. The packet must follow the format as specified, a `Start of Packet (SoP)` followed by the command and then the `End of Packet (EoP)`. The command is executed only if the SoP and EoP are correctly received.

| SoP  | LED status | EoP  |
|------|------------|------|
| 0x01 | 0x00 or 0x01 | 0x17 |
